# Weight Littering Modeling

This is the codebase for the Agent Based Modeling course at the UvA (University of Amsterdam) for the project Agent Based Littering.

## Requirements
This codebase uses Python (only tested on 3.11) and Jupyter Notebooks. To install all the requirements run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Understanding the code
This codebase contains two important files, ```gymmodel.py``` and ```experiments.ipynb```, the code for the experiments is (obviously) in the latter file, while the main model is in the first.
